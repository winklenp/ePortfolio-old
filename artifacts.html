                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>
                    My definition of interdisciplinarity is
                    combining more than one discipline in order
                    to create a more well rounded citizen.
                </p>
                <h3>Metaphor</h3>
                <p>
                    My metaphor for interdisciplinarity is of
                    fire and gasoline. The fire is the initial 
                    passion. (for me its programming) The gasoline
                    are the 'accessory' disiplines that feed the fire
                    of the initial passion. By combining disciplines you 
                    reach deeper levels of understanding and effectivness
                    than you would have otherwise.

                <p>Both of these projects required tremendous communication with my management team, as well

                    someone elses vision come to life, and effective communication is key to keeping tensions
                    down, and everyone happy.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    To be honest, I joined the interdisciplinary program because
                    it was the fastest way to get my degree. I have been in school
                    for 5 years now, have taken too many classes, and have already 
                    been working in my field. When my previous advisor recommended the
                    degree to me - it sounded perfect, but I didnt know anything about
                    it. After joining, however, I have found that I should have been
                    in this degree from the beginning. It is exactly what I was looking
                    for - learning about my interests and creating the degree plan
                    that best works for me. It has allowed me to study topics like 
                    traditional computer science, as well as IT game development, and 
                    philosophy and communications courses. I have thouroughly enjoyed 
                    this degree program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that this style of study will spread like wildfire across
                    the country - especially with the advent on online learning. Students 
                    are already leading their learning in online school, it makes sense
                    for them to craft the degree themselves (within reason).
